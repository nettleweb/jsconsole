# JSConsole
JSConsole is a complete rewrite the debug console within <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome DevTools</a> in pure JavaScript. It is mainly used in the following cases:
 - The browser does not have a built-in debug console (ie. Chrome on Android)
 - The built-in console is blocked by the device policy. This happens on most managed Chromebooks.

There is also a demo version of JSConsole available on the <a href="https://whitespider.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhiteSpider website</a>.
